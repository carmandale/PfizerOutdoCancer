this is my ADCMovementSystem. ADCs (Antibody Drug Conjugates) are launched by the user at cancer cells. the ADCs target the antigens on the cancer cells. Each cancer cell will die after a certain number of ADCs attach to it. ADCs can be launched by looking at a cancer cell and doing a spatial tap, or for a small percentage, an ADC can be launched when looking at anything. these are categorized into "natural" launches, when targeting a cancer cell, and "untargeted" launches, when looking at something else. for natural launches, the ADC travels to the cell and attaches. if the cell dies before the ADC reaches its target, it will retarget and search for a new cell to attach to. for the untargeted launches, after a certain period of time, the cell will retarget and look for a cancer cell. if all of the cells are destroyed and there are no viable targets, the ADC enters .orbiting mode and every second will look for a viable target. if a new cell is spawned, it will target it.

everything is looking great and working great for the most part. the issue that I want you to look into is that when a cell is in orbiting mode, and a new cell appears, it will target that cell and attach to it, but the normal process, which involves landing with an offset, triggering the antigen to retract, and eventually leading to the cell death doesn't happen for some reason. I would like for you to look into why that is.
