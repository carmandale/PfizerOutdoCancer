# Immersive Space Transition Sequence

## Current Issue
When transitioning from BuildingSpace to AttackSpace (clicking "Attack Cancer"), the app crashes with "Connection to vhmdd - invalid" because we're trying to switch immersive spaces while the current space is still active.

## Required Sequence

1. Initial State (BuildingSpace):
   - BuildingSpace immersive space is active
   - ADCOptimizedImmersive view is mounted
   - Debug window is open
   - Main view window is open
   - ADCAppModel.immersiveSpaceState = .open

2. "Attack Cancer" Button Click:
   a. Set ADCAppModel.immersiveSpaceState = .inTransition
   b. Dismiss windows in the following order:
      - First, dismiss the debug window
      - Then, dismiss the main view window
      - Update respective isOpen flags accordingly
   c. Call dismissImmersiveSpace() only after all windows have been closed
   d. Wait for ADCOptimizedImmersive.onDisappear
      - This sets ADCAppModel.immersiveSpaceState = .closed
   e. Add a brief delay to ensure complete cleanup

3. Phase Transition:
   - Once the immersive space is fully closed:
     a. Call appModel.transitionToPhase(.playing)
     b. This updates currentImmersiveSpace to "AttackSpace"
     c. visionOS manages opening the new space

## Key Points
- Avoid switching immersive spaces while one is active
- Always dismiss all windows before dismissing the immersive space
- Use state transitions (.open -> .inTransition -> .closed) to track progress
- Incorporate appropriate delays between operations to ensure proper teardown and setup
- Maintain consistent handling of window state flags

## Files to Modify
1. ADCBuilderView.swift - Update the logic for the "Attack Cancer" button to reflect the new transition sequence
2. ADCOptimizedImmersive.swift - Ensure proper cleanup within the onDisappear method
3. ADCAppModel.swift - Implement tracking for state transitions
4. AppModel.swift - Manage the phase transition following the dismissal of the immersive space
