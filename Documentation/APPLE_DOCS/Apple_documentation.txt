# Apple Official Documentation Excerpts

## Managing Immersive Spaces
- "An immersive space is a temporary scene that takes over the entire view, allowing users to focus on a specific task or experience."
- "Ensure the immersive space is dismissed before initiating a transition to avoid conflicts."

## Best Practices for Dismissing Windows
- "Dismiss ephemeral windows in the order they were presented to ensure proper teardown."
- "Use appropriate state management to track the visibility of windows."

## Handling Transitions
- "Always verify the current state of the immersive space before starting a transition."
- "Incorporate delays to accommodate teardown processes before launching a new immersive space."

## State Management in visionOS
- "Utilize custom state properties to track transitions, ensuring a clean handoff between spaces."
- "Implement onDisappear handlers to confirm that views are completely dismissed before proceeding."
