# Build Warnings PRD for PfizerOutdoCancer

## Overview
This document organizes, prioritizes, and assesses the importance and risk associated with various Xcode build warnings encountered in the PfizerOutdoCancer project. The warnings span both our main application code and our RealityKitContent package. Addressing these warnings will enhance code clarity and maintain long-term compatibility with VisionOS 2 best practices.

## Table of Warnings and Prioritization

| **Warning Source** | **Warning Message** | **Severity** | **Risk Assessment** | **Recommended Action** | **Comments** |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| **AntigenComponent.swift**<br>(Line 6) | *"Immutable property will not be decoded because it is declared with an initial value which cannot be overwritten"* | Medium | Decoding models may not update expected values, possibly affecting behavior if these properties must reflect dynamic input. | Remove the default initial value or change the property to a mutable one (or use an initializer that supports decoding) so that the decoding mechanism can update it. | Verify that changes do not affect downstream decoding paths. |
| **ADCOptimizedImmersive.swift**<br>(Lines 342, 356, 364, 446, 456, 466, 477) | *"No calls to throwing functions occur within 'try' expression"*<br>*"'catch' block is unreachable because no errors are thrown in 'do' block"* | Low | These warnings indicate redundant try/throw and catch constructs that clutter the code but do not affect runtime behavior. | Remove unnecessary `try` expressions and corresponding `catch` blocks to simplify error handling. | Clean-up phase only—verify that removal does not hide potential future error handling needs. |
| **ADCOptimizedImmersive+Entities.swift**<br>(Lines 44, 46) | *"No calls to throwing functions occur within 'try' expression"*<br>*"'catch' block is unreachable because no errors are thrown in 'do' block"* | Low | Redundant error handling instructions that are safe to remove. | Remove unnecessary try-catch constructs to streamline the code. | This change improves code readability. |
| **ADCOptimizedImmersive+Gestures.swift**<br>(Lines 74, 167, 206) | *"No 'async' operations occur within 'await' expression"* | Low | Using `await` without any asynchronous operation may introduce superﬂuous code and minor performance overhead. | Remove the unnecessary `await` keywords where no async function is being called. | Review each instance to ensure functionality remains unaffected. |
| **ADCCheckmarkButton.swift**<br>(Line 43) | *"'onChange(of:perform:)' was deprecated in visionOS 1.0: Use `onChange` with a two or zero parameter action closure instead."* | Medium | Deprecated API usage could lead to future compatibility problems with visionOS updates. | Update the `onChange` API usage according to the latest VisionOS guidelines. | Reference Apple's updated documentation to adjust the closure signature. |
| **AppModel+AssetLoading.swift**<br>(Lines 44, 49) | *"No calls to throwing functions occur within 'try' expression"*<br>*"'catch' block is unreachable because no errors are thrown in 'do' block"* | Low | These warnings are redundant and do not impact runtime behavior. | Remove redundant try/catch blocks to reduce code clutter. | Verify that the removal does not remove placeholder error handling if needed later. |
| **AssetLoadingManager.swift**<br>(Line 498) | *"No 'async' operations occur within 'await' expression"* | Low | Indicates an unnecessary use of `await` where no asynchronous task exists. | Remove the `await` keyword if it is not required, or refactor if an async operation was intended. | Confirm with team whether this was a mistake or a placeholder for future functionality. |
| **AssetLoadingManager+Lab.swift**<br>(Lines 138, 142) | *"No 'async' operations occur within 'await' expression"* | Low | Similar to the previous warning, it results in redundant code. | Remove the `await` keywords to simplify the code. | Verify that the removal does not affect the intended asynchronous behavior. |
| **Entity+Find.swift**<br>(Line 14) | *"Conditional downcast from 'T?' to 'T' does nothing"* | Low | The conditional downcast is redundant and may hide ineffective type checks. | Remove the unnecessary downcast. | This is a simple code cleanup edit. |
| **TrackingSessionManager.swift**<br>(Lines 167–168) | *"Cast from '[any DataProvider]' to unrelated type 'WorldTrackingProvider' always fails"<br>"Cast from '[any DataProvider]' to unrelated type 'HandTrackingProvider' always fails"<br>"Will never be executed"* | High | Essential tracking functionality (world and hand tracking) may be compromised if the cast fails in production. | Revisit and adjust the type conversion logic for DataProvider. Verify the correct types provided by RealityKit and ensure proper casting. | High-priority review needed. Consult with lead developer to align with current RealityKit and VisionOS APIs. |
| **ADCMovementSystem.swift**<br>(Line 407) | *"Initialization of immutable value 'previousHits' was never used; consider replacing with assignment to '_' or removing it"* | Low | Unused variable that clutters code. | Remove or rename the unused variable. | No impact on functionality; purely a cleanup. |
| **ADCMovementSystem+Retargeting.swift**<br>(Line 251) | *"Value 'target' was defined but never used; consider replacing with boolean test"* | Low | Redundant variable that should be removed to simplify the code. | Remove the unused variable or refactor the code to use a boolean test as suggested. | Improves clarity with minimal impact. |
| **AttachmentSystem.swift**<br>(Line 89) | *"Value 'bestPoint' was defined but never used; consider replacing with boolean test"* | Low | Minor unused variable issue. | Remove the unused assignment and use a boolean test if necessary. | Clean-up for readability only. |
| **AttackCancerViewModel+ADC.swift**<br>(Several Lines) | *"No calls to throwing functions occur within 'try' expression"<br>"No 'async' operations occur within 'await' expression"<br>"'catch' block is unreachable"* | Low | Redundant error handling in asynchronous code paths increases code noise. | Remove unnecessary try/await and unreachable catch blocks to streamline the logic. | Code cleanup with no runtime impact. |
| **AttackCancerViewModel+SceneSetup.swift**<br>(Line 178) | *"Initialization of immutable value 'launchPosition' was never used; consider replacing with assignment to '_' or removing it"* | Low | Leftover code likely from an earlier implementation and can be removed. | Remove the unused variable. | Ensures the code remains concise. |
| **IntroViewModel.swift**<br>(Lines 253, 364) | *"Main actor-isolated property 'parent' cannot be referenced from a nonisolated context; this is an error in the Swift 6 language mode"*<br>*"Immutable value 'extras' was never used; consider replacing with '_' or removing it"* | High | Main actor isolation issues can lead to threading problems and potential crashes in a VisionOS context. The unused variable indicates incomplete refactoring. | Refactor the code so that access to the main actor-isolated property occurs within a MainActor context and remove any unused variables. | This is critical since it can affect UI stability. |
| **IntroView.swift**<br>(Line 114) | *"'catch' block is unreachable because no errors are thrown in 'do' block"* | Low | Redundant catch block that does not cause harm but may confuse developers. | Remove the unreachable catch block. | Simple cleanup for clarity. |

## Risk and Impact Prioritization

1. **High Severity**  
   - **TrackingSessionManager.swift Cast Issues:**  
     *Risk:* High impact on core tracking functionality (world and hand tracking).  
     *Action:* Immediate investigation and update of type conversions.  
   - **IntroViewModel.swift Main Actor Issue:**  
     *Risk:* Can lead to runtime failures, UI freezes, or crashes in a visionOS environment.  
     *Action:* Refactor the code with proper actor isolation immediately.

2. **Medium Severity**  
   - **AntigenComponent.swift Decoding Warning:**  
     *Risk:* May lead to data issues if the property value is expected to be updated through decoding.  
     *Action:* Adjust the model's property configuration to allow proper decoding.  
   - **ADCCheckmarkButton.swift Deprecation Warning:**  
     *Risk:* Future compatibility; deprecated APIs can be removed or changed in upcoming visionOS updates.  
     *Action:* Update the API usage as per Apple's updated guidelines.

3. **Low Severity**  
   - Redundant try/await/catch blocks in ADCOptimizedImmersive, AssetLoading-related files, and AttackCancerViewModel files.  
     *Risk:* These do not affect runtime but degrade code quality and increase maintenance overhead.  
     *Action:* Clean up the code by removing unnecessary constructs.  
   - Unused variable warnings in ADCMovementSystem, AttachmentSystem, etc.  
     *Risk:* Minor clutter which could be misleading during debugging.  
     *Action:* Remove unused variables.

## Proposed Action Plan

### Immediate (High Priority)
- **TrackingSessionManager.swift:**  
  Review and correct the casting logic for `[any DataProvider]` to obtain valid `WorldTrackingProvider` and `HandTrackingProvider` instances.
- **IntroViewModel.swift:**  
  Refactor the code to ensure that all accesses to main actor–isolated properties (like `parent`) occur within a MainActor-protected context. Remove unused variables.

### Short Term (Within Next Sprint)
- **AntigenComponent.swift:**  
  Adjust the declaration of properties that are failing to decode by either removing their default values or marking them as mutable.
- **ADCCheckmarkButton.swift:**  
  Update the deprecated `onChange(of:perform:)` usage to conform with the new VisionOS API.
- Clean up all redundant try/await/catch blocks and remove any unused variables across affected files.

### Long Term
- Introduce linter or SwiftLint rules to catch redundant try/await usage and unused declarations to prevent recurrence.
- Schedule a periodic code quality review to address warnings collectively and maintain best practices across the codebase.
- Re-test the entire application thoroughly (including tracking and actor isolation aspects) after these clean-up measures to avoid regressions.

## Conclusion
Most of the warnings are low risk and relate to redundant code that can be easily cleaned up. However, the high-severity warnings in the tracking system and the actor isolation issues in IntroViewModel have the potential to affect core functionality, especially in the visionOS context. Addressing these promptly is essential to maintain application stability and compatibility with future updates.

## Next Steps
- **Review:** Please review the above priorities and action items.
- **Assign:** We will assign tasks for immediate and short-term fixes.
- **Track:** Use our issue-tracking system to monitor the progress on these warnings.
- **Follow-up:** A follow-up review meeting will be scheduled post implementation to verify all warnings have been appropriately addressed.
