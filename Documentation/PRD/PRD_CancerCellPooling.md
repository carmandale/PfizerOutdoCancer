# Cancer Cell Pooling System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for optimizing cancer cell spawning through a pooling system. The goal is to improve performance by pre-creating and managing a pool of cancer cells while maintaining the existing game mechanics and visual effects.

## Current Implementation Analysis
The current system spawns cancer cells sequentially with a 0.2s delay between spawns, which introduces several performance challenges:
1. **Runtime Overhead**: Each spawn operation performs:
   - Entity cloning (computationally expensive)
   - Physics component configuration
   - Movement parameter setup
   - State component initialization
   - Attachment point configuration
   - Fade-in animation
2. **Performance Impact**:
   - Sequential spawning with delays causes noticeable stutters
   - Heavy runtime operations during gameplay
   - No reuse of existing entities
3. **Current Metrics**:
   - Spawning 20 cells takes ~4 seconds with delays
   - Each spawn operation causes potential frame drops
   - Memory allocations occur during gameplay

## Performance Considerations
- Cloning entities during gameplay can cause frame drops
- Physics component initialization is resource-intensive
- Multiple simultaneous operations (spawning, physics, animations) can impact performance
- visionOS 2 performance requirements need special consideration

## Performance Goals
1. Reduce spawn-related frame drops by 80%
2. Complete 20-cell spawn sequence in <0.5 seconds (vs current ~4 seconds)
3. Zero noticeable frame drops during spawn on Vision Pro hardware
4. Maintain consistent 60fps during cell activation/deactivation

## Proposed Solution: Cell Pooling System

### Core Components

#### 1. CancerCellPool Class
```swift
@Observable
final class CancerCellPool {
    private var availableCells: [Entity]
    private var activeCells: [Entity]
    private let poolSize: Int
    private let template: Entity
    
    var onCellRecycled: ((Entity) -> Void)?
    var onCellActivated: ((Entity) -> Void)?
    
    // NEW: Monitoring properties
    var activeCount: Int { activeCells.count }
    var availableCount: Int { availableCells.count }
}
```

#### 2. Pool Management Functions
- `initializePool(count: Int)`: Pre-creates all cells
- `acquireCell() -> Entity?`: Gets next available cell
- `recycleCell(_ cell: Entity)`: Returns cell to pool
- `resetPool()`: Resets all cells to initial state

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Pool Setup and Initialization
1. Create pool during `AttackCancerViewModel` initialization
2. Pre-configure all cells with:
   - Physics components
   - State components
   - Attachment points
   - Initial transforms
3. Set initial opacity to 0 and disable entities
4. NEW: Implement progressive loading for large pools
5. NEW: Add pool size monitoring and optimization

#### Phase 2: Spawn System Modification with Concurrency
1. Modify `spawnCancerCells` to use pool and TaskGroup for concurrent activation:
   ```swift
   func spawnCancerCells(in root: Entity, count: Int) async {
       var frontSpawnCount = 0
       
       await withTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { group in
           for i in 0..<count {
               group.addTask {
                   guard let cell = await self.cellPool.acquireCell() else { return }
                   let preferFront = frontSpawnCount < Int(Double(count) * 0.5)
                   await self.activateCell(cell, index: i, preferFront: preferFront)
                   
                   if preferFront {
                       await MainActor.run { frontSpawnCount += 1 }
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Cell State Management
1. Implement optimized cell activation:
   ```swift
   func activateCell(_ cell: Entity, index: Int, preferFront: Bool) async {
       await MainActor.run {
           configureCellPosition(cell, preferFront: preferFront)
           cell.isEnabled = true
       }
       await cell.fadeOpacity(to: 1.0, duration: 0.5)
   }
   ```

2. Implement efficient cell recycling:
   ```swift
   func recycleCell(_ cell: Entity) async {
       await cell.fadeOpacity(to: 0.0, duration: 0.5)
       await MainActor.run {
           cell.isEnabled = false
           resetCellState(cell)
           cellPool.recycleCell(cell)
       }
   }
   ```

### Integration with Existing Systems
