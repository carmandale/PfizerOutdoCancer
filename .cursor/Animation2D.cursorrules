# 2D Animation for UI Views

Animations in SwiftUI can enhance your UI by providing smooth, natural transitions. Follow Apple’s recommendations to use implicit animations and system-provided timing curves.

### Key Guidelines

- **Animate with Purpose:**  
  Only animate changes that improve clarity or provide necessary feedback. Avoid gratuitous motion.

- **Use SwiftUI’s Animation API:**  
  Use the built-in animation modifiers (like `.animation` and `withAnimation`) and prefer system‑provided easing options.

- **Keep Performance in Mind:**  
  Ensure animations are lightweight and do not trigger expensive layout recalculations.

### Example

The following snippet demonstrates a button that animates its scale when tapped:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct AnimatedButton: View {
    @State private var scale: CGFloat = 1.0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Me") {
            withAnimation(.spring(response: 0.3, dampingFraction: 0.5, blendDuration: 0)) {
                scale = (scale == 1.0 ? 1.2 : 1.0)
            }
        }
        .scaleEffect(scale)
        .padding()
    }
}
